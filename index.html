        <p>
            The games are getting better and evolving along with technology.
            Many of us had played pixelated graphics games with Nintendo ’s
            first SNES console and those games were so addicting.  Nowadays
            we can play almost real-looking modern graphics games on PC,
            latest generation consoles and even with smartphones.
